BHTS Hackathon competitive savings

We designed an app with the purpose being to spread financial literacy within college students. 
We utilized CSS, HTML, JS, for front end, Native React as a framework & for graphical analysis, Figma for 
design, an API for a chat bot, and UX/UI for maximizing user experience. This was all done within Capital One's
Hackathon challenge, "Banking for Good", where we placed as finalists in the competition.
